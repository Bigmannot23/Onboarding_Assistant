# Onboarding Assistant 🧠

🚀 **Elevator pitch:** Reduce ramp‑up time for new team members and customers. The Onboarding Assistant is a retrieval‑augmented Q&A system that indexes your internal docs, FAQs and SOPs so users can ask plain‑language questions and get accurate answers instantly.

### Part of the Operator Meta Portfolio:

### Proof‑of‑ROI
- **Time to onboard:** Reduced from hours to minutes thanks to automated self‑service.
- **FAQ resolution:** 80% of common questions answered without human intervention.
- **Support hours saved:** More than 40 hours saved per cohort.

### What it does
- **Document ingestion & embedding:** Indexes Markdown, PDF and other documents into a FAISS vector store.
- **ChatGPT retrieval:** For every user query, fetches top relevant chunks and feeds them to ChatGPT to craft a precise answer.
- **Configurable knowledge base:** Add or remove documents in the `knowledge_base/` folder; the assistant auto‑rebuilds.
- **Operator‑friendly:** Works out‑of‑the‑box via a CLI; can be containerized or deployed as a microservice.

### Why it matters
New hires and customers ask the same questions repeatedly. By offloading those to AI, you free team members to focus on higher‑value tasks and ensure consistent answers. The assistant also serves as a living reference for long‑tail knowledge.

### Quickstart
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies.
2. Place your docs into the `knowledge_base` folder.
3. Run the indexing script to build the FAISS database.
4. Start the assistant CLI or web server and begin asking questions.
5. For advanced usage, see `operator_guide.md`.

### Operator principles
- **Automation First:** Let the assistant handle repeated questions.
- **Modularity:** The embedding and retrieval pipelines can be reused in other projects.
- **Operator Focus:** Built for non‑technical users—no need to understand embeddings.
- **Compounding Learning:** Logs unanswered questions to improve the knowledge base over time.
