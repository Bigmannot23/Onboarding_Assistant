# Personal Philosophy & Feedback Loops

This document captures the personal philosophies and feedback loops that underpin our work.

## Compounding Systems

We treat every project as part of a larger operating system.  Lessons learned feed into new builds.  Checklists, libraries, and prompts are version‑controlled and reused.  Nothing is one‑off.

## Feedback as Fuel

We embrace constructive feedback from users, peers, and the systems themselves.  Metrics, bug reports, and user questions inform our next iteration.  We close the loop by acting on that feedback quickly.

## Version Control in Life and Work

Just as code lives in Git, our documents and processes are versioned.  Changes are logged, reversible, and auditable.  This fosters accountability and enables fast experimentation without fear.

## Always Be Learning

Every build is a chance to sharpen skills.  We spend time reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve.  This reflection is built into our workflow via retro meetings and after‑action reports.
