# Engineering Principles

At Lexvion Solutions, our engineering philosophy emphasizes pragmatism, maintainability, and scalability.  These principles guide our technical decisions and day‑to‑day work.

## 1. Modularity

Break systems into composable, well‑defined components.  Small modules are easier to test, extend, and reuse in future projects.

## 2. Automation First

We invest in automation up front to save time down the road.  If a task is repeated more than twice, automate it.

## 3. Instrument Everything

Measure key metrics and log important events.  Data enables us to make informed decisions and improve our systems.

## 4. Document for Operators

Write READMEs and operator guides that enable others to set up, run, and extend our systems without hand‑holding.

## 5. Security & Privacy by Design

Protect user data and credentials.  Never hardcode secrets in code.  Use environment variables, secrets managers, and encryption where appropriate.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

Refactor and iterate based on feedback.  Don’t be afraid to throw away early versions in pursuit of better designs.

These principles should be tailored to your own team’s standards.  Feel free to expand on them or replace them entirely.
